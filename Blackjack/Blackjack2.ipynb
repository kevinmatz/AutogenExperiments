            "Please note that this is a very basic implementation. Invoking the '/hit' or '/stand' routes currently does nothing, because these functions are not implemented yet. Actually implementing these functions would require preserving state between different requests, which is beyond the scope of a simple Flask app. You could use session variables or entrust state management to the client (e.g., by incorporating JavaScript and sending the current game state with each response). This is a good starting point, but building a fully-fledged blackjack game with Flask would be a considerably larger project.\n",
